\item{PenSDK\\PenSDK is a low level API for implementing various types of pens, the API is used internally by korean PenUP mobile Samsung Team. \\
Here I worked leading a team of three people porting the OpenGL ES(mobile) code to desktop DirectX and making sure everything kept running smoothly and all graphical effects were kept intact.\\
My role included teaching graphics technologies like OpenGL and DirectX in order to leverage the team, create a plan to port some critical brushes and its features, 
create a desktop architecture for graphic rendering with only needed features, create a implementation plan, negotiate critical features with Korea and keep them informed along all steps.\\
Most of the code is native (C++) for performance and interoperatibility between UWP and DirectX/OpenGL.\\}
\item{Live Message\\
